# Vue SSR memory leak when error occur

#### how to reproduce ?

__env__: Node 10.22.0

__source__: in src fold

__bundle code__: `bundle_error.js`, `bundle_success.js`

__test code__: `test_success.js`, `test_error.js`

First of all, install dependencies: ```npm install```

#### What is actually happening?
run error test: ```node test_error```, 

you can see the result is like this:

![error](./test_error_result.png)

one snapshot of `blockStack` is like this :

![error_debug_info](./error_debug_info.png)

The problem is : `blockStack` grows every time it is executed, `blockStack` is not freed when something error occur.

#### What is expected?

`blockStack` should be cleared.

#### Other info

we can see the success case, in this case, "we add data to btnPro", like this:

![app](./app.png)

and then , run success test: ```node test_success```, we can see the result is like this:
![error](./test_success_result.png)

one snapshot of `blockStack` is like this:

![success_debug_info](./success_debug_info.png)

we can see the length of `blockStack` is always zero when function `closeBlock` is called, and the memory behaving normally.

#### Question
Is this is a bug ? If so, Maybe we need an method like `clearBlockStack` so that we can free the `blockStack` in time when some error occur. If not, we would be very grateful if you tell us how to solve this problem. At last, Thanks for reading this issue. :)
